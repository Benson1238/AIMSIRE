AimRare Hub v6.5 is a client-side utility script for Roblox, providing a customizable legit-style aimbot, ESP visual tools, and a modern Fluent UI interface.
This version introduces improved performance, prediction-based aiming, and a redesigned Fluent UI.

Note: This script requires an executor that supports the Drawing API.

Key Features
🎯 Legit Aimbot

FOV-based target selection

Smooth camera interpolation (legit-style aim assist)

Hit chance simulation

Velocity-based aim prediction

Multiple aim parts (Head, UpperTorso, HumanoidRootPart)

Hold or toggle aiming modes

Optional wall-check using raycasting

Team and alive checks

👁 ESP System

Full player visualization system including:

Box ESP

Skeleton ESP (R15 + R6 support)

Name & Distance ESP

Micro-optimized math and Drawing calls

Reused RaycastParams

ESP caching system

Conditional rendering

Single RenderStepped loop

Predictive aiming for smoother behavior

Changelog (v6.5)

Migrated interface to the Fluent UI library

Implemented velocity prediction for more accurate target leading

Cleaned and restructured ESP + Drawing systems

Replaced older GUI logic with modern UI handling

Improved performance and reduced redundant calculations

Requirements

To use this script, you need:

A Roblox executor that supports:

Drawing.new() API

HttpGet() (for UI library loading)

A device capable of handling continuous rendering loops

How It Works
Aimbot Workflow

Detects closest player within the FOV circle

Applies team/wall/alive checks

Predicts future target position

Smoothly interpolates camera CFrame towards predicted point

Applies randomization based on HitChance

ESP Workflow

Creates a Drawing object set for each player

Calculates on-screen positions using the camera

Draws boxes, skeletons, names, and health bars

Hides or removes ESP if a player leaves or is not visible

Configuration

All default settings are located in the Settings table:

Settings = {
    AimbotEnabled = false,
    AimbotFOV = 100,
    AimbotSmooth = 0.2,
    AimbotHitChance = 100,
    AimPart = "Head",
    BoxESP = false,
    SkeletonESP = false,
    NameESP = false,
    HealthESP = false,
    TeamCheck = false,
    WallCheck = false,
    AliveCheck = true,
    ShowWatermark = true,
}

UI Tabs Overview
Legit Aim Tab

Toggle aimbot

Adjust FOV, smoothness, hit chance

Choose aim part

Visuals Tab

Toggle box, skeleton, health, and name ESP

Enable team filtering

Settings Tab

Toggle watermark display

Unload the script entirely

Error Handling

If the Drawing API is missing, the script stops with a warning

Missing UI library loads are caught via pcall

ESP objects automatically remove themselves when a player leaves

Unloading the Script

The built-in "Unload Script" button:

Disconnects all connections

Removes all Drawing objects

Clears ESP cache

Destroys the Fluent UI window

This ensures a clean reset without restarting Roblox.

Disclaimer

This script modifies client-side rendering and camera behavior.
It does not interact with or modify Roblox server logic.
Compatibility and performance depend on the user's executor and hardware.
