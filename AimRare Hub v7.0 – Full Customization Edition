Unload Function

The script provides a complete unload routine that:

Disconnects all render loops

Removes all Drawing objects

Clears ESP caches and prediction caches

Removes the FOV circle and watermark

Destroys the Fluent UI window

This ensures the script leaves no residual objects or connections.

AimRare Hub operates entirely on the client side and does not modify server-side systems.
Performance and feature availability depend on the executor used and its Drawing API support.
