ESP System

Supports several on-screen overlays for player visualization:

Box ESP

General cleanup and internal restructuring for improved readability and performance

Requirements

To run this script successfully, the executor must support:

Drawing API (Drawing.new)

HttpGet for loading the Fluent UI library

Stable RenderStepped execution

Performance will depend on hardware and the number of active Drawing objects.

How the System Works
Aimbot Processing

Selects the closest viable target within the configured FOV radius.

Applies alive, team, and wall checks when enabled.

Calculates predicted aim position using distance-based time and user-defined prediction speed.

Interpolates the camera toward the predicted target location using a smoothing factor.

Applies configured hit chance before executing aim logic.

ESP Rendering

Maintains a cache of Drawing objects per player.

Projects character positions onto the screen each frame.

Draws ESP elements such as boxes, names, skeletons, health bars, and distances if enabled.

Handles per-player cleanup when characters or players are removed.

Configuration

All core adjustable values are stored in the Settings table, for example:

AimbotEnabled = false
AimbotFOV = 100
AimbotSmooth = 0.2
AimbotHitChance = 100
PredictionSpeed = 1000
AimPart = "Head"
BoxESP = false
SkeletonESP = false
NameESP = false
HealthESP = false
TeamCheck = false
WallCheck = false
ShowWatermark = true


Most settings can also be modified directly through the Fluent UI.

Script Unloading

The script includes an unload function accessible in the Settings tab.
Executing it will:

Disconnect the RenderStepped loop

Remove all Drawing objects

Clear ESP caches

Remove the FOV circle and watermark

Destroy the Fluent UI window

This ensures clean termination without requiring a client restart.
